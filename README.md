# DatabaseViewerApp
The goal of this work is to implement a web application using Java and JavaScript languages, along with a relational database. The application will allow the creation of virtual table spaces for different users on a single database. Each user will see their own table space, where they can perform CRUD operations, as well as import and export data. The project also includes performance testing of the implemented solution. The backend of the application will be implemented using the SpringBoot framework, while the frontend will be developed in ReactJS. The database can be implemented using Oracle, MySQL, or another database engine. It is also permissible to use Amazon or Microsoft cloud services.
The project is a final project for engineering studies in computer science field.

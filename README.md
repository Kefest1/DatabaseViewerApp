# DatabaseViewerApp
 The goal of this work is to implement a web application using Java and JavaScript languages, along with a relational database. The application will allow the creation of virtual table spaces for different users on a single database. Each user will see their own table space, where they can perform CRUD operations, as well as import and export data.
